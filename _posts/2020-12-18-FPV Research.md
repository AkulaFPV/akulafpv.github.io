I've been geeking on FPV drone stuff like this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEm22P_ARgs

DRL is Drone Racing League, DRL SIM is the simulator for drone racing -- to me it is important because it is a video game which uses the actual drone controller hooked up to your PC, plus real-to-life physics for the drones in the game -- and you can hook up the drone goggles like you would use when you really fly. FPV drones are all .. different-brand-name motors of different sizes soldered onto flight controllers and speed controllers, and different props and frames, different weights, different battery sizes (weight, simulated) the company that makes the game has employees testing all the motors and props and putting the real specs into the game (there's like 6 videos here: https://store.steampowered.com/app/641780/The_Drone_Racing_League_Simulator/) all those drone products are all available on the real life market and in the game they have real gravity and aerodynamics -- it provides a great way to practice flying drones, without flying a drone and damaging your drone.

I can't fly at night, I can't fly when it's cloudy.. and I wanna do this drone thing but need to practice.. So this Drone Simulator uses a real drone controller, the same one I might use for a racing drone, so I can truly practice in a true-to-form but still virtual way. So I think I'm buying that stuff next week or whatever, just wanted to let you know how the drone thing is going.

There is a DJI Digital FPV setu; you make your own drone but the setup includes 3 major parts: the goggles, the controller, and the air unit (the camera which goes on the drone which connects to the goggles via radio) but it's like $1000.. so I'm looking more into the mix-and-match setups or making it cheap as possible. There are different drones split into class basically by battery size. Analog is definitely cheaper than the digital FPV for the drones because analog has been the way for 15 years and digital is the new thing so it is $180 part in any drone you build when an analog Video Transmitor (VTX) can be $25

So - there are different drone categories
-- TinyWhoop (1s [one cell] batteries) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd2V8vMhxJM [video not super great but its a little itty bitty drone for $100 which connects to any analog Goggle+Controller setup]
-- whoops/4-inch quads (or 5 inch quads) (battery: 3, 4, or 6s) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qJoMrEybzM -- the ones in this video are pre-made: pretty lame compared to buying a frame and motors and individual parts and really building your own drone like this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuUlXBJo-Xw
-- or cinewhoops (3,4,6s battery with a gopro mount and they have ducts which are shells around the propellors which provide more thrust and as an added bonus the ducts prevent damage because they could crash into a wall or a person and not cut them with the spinning blades ) http://www.shendrones.com/squirt-v2

And then theres a few different brands of FPV goggles, Fat Shark seems to be the most popular one and DJI just recently got in the FPV game - DJI is only digital (the new thing), to fly using DJI goggles with the cheaper analog drones it is only a $15 module: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUGjDr3WlVE and then its kinda future proof because digital is most likely the future..

So yeah I'm thinking of not buying the full DJI Set, just getting the goggles, adding the module to make them backwards compatible for the cheaper Analog drones and flying a tinywhoop in real life to start. I'd get some controller which is already integrated with the DRL SIM, so that I have exact match from my virtual practice races to real life flying. My winning combo so far in my research is the DJI goggles with maybe Taranis controller, or some other controller. I haven't pin-pointed the controller that I really should use for the FPV drone racing yet but this is a huge motivator for using the DJI goggles: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hv5pqc6kHE -- you connect the goggles to your PC for the FPV flying experience and you use whatever controller. And for real life drones I guess I'm looking at this Mobula6 because its a 1S drone for like $100 and I'd probably have to spend 300-500$ to build a 4inch FPV quad with the dji digital air unit, closer to 300 if I did an analog air unit (VTX) instead of HD DJI cool new drone standard

Jaimie crashed in new mexico, and so did I (i was more upset about my crash than he was about his), and I realized the DJI drones are not meant for up-close sporty shots, it's just a more cinematic type of drone - very good for panoramos and the Photo modes, because they aren't made for anything fast and really can't be repaired beyond replacing propellors. So the whole custom FPV drone thing is really appealing to me for a ton of reasons, you can repair you drone, you can build your drone from scratch and maybe sell it as a Ready-to-fly drone.. you can fly them yourself, you can get cool footage for instagram, get paid on film contracts.. You could sell ready-to-use DJI goggles with the added analog module for a significant markup.. get a lot more in depth knowledge of drones by building them and tuning them with the BetaFlight software and actually be deep into the drones rather than have the ready-to-fly super cool drone with the awesome camera. with the drones you make, you make them and strap a gopro to them. I've edited Johnny FPV footage when I worked for formula drift. He was at one of the FD events as a contractor and gave Chabin (the producer) the SD cards from the gopros on his drones. Johnny FPV is the number one drone flyer in the world, most subscribers on youtube, the whole deal, and he made his career out of drone racing.. it hones your ability to film the correct thing at the correct time under immense stress and be a better pilot.

My boss was telling me about this machine they used to cut a ton of trees across the street from his house: it was this thing: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nuuPI2hyt6M -- and man I wish he had called me so I could've flimed that on my Mavic. So cool. But the machine is so effecient they cut down the whole field in one afternoon. I am thinking about putting the word out there for like : "Free Filming - Just notify me if you are doing something cool..." Film stuff and get a showreel going and put together a 6-months-of-Drone video. The drone thing has been really interesting to me and I've been bummed about not flying because it has been overcast for like 7 days, every day since I got my iPad it has been like a shitty day outside and I haven't wanted to fly so I haven't actually tried it out yet. Drone Simulator is something I found out about today and I was like WOW. YEA.
