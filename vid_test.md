### Some example footage of mine (lowered resolution)

<video src="https://github.com/murdockFPV/murdockfpv.github.io/blob/master/images/LUNCH-PEAK-LOOKOUT.mp4?raw=true" poster="https://github.com/murdockFPV/murdockfpv.github.io/blob/master/images/akulafpvlunchpeak.jpg?raw=true" style="max-width: 100%; max-height: 100%" controls preload></video>

*Thanks for visiting my blog!* This specific page is me posting some drone footage like I might do for a client. You are welcome to view this as an example if you were to contact me for my services.

#### More information

* You might be wondering why I don't post this video on youtube, there are situations where I can't post certain content to my youtube. This entire page is a test of the alternate solution for those situations.  
* This is a semi-private page on my blog. It is not linked to anywhere else on the site, but the page exists. You can't navigate to this page from the rest of the blog, but (warning, I guess) anyone that knows it exists can see it.
* This is not posted on youtube and it is more of a preview situation (As an example)
* My deliverables can be up to 4K resolution and 60 FPS -- This video is 1080P 24FPS with a watermark.
* Before I have recieved payment for client work, here is where I can upload very short, watermarked and low-resolution video previews to a dedicated page on my blog, then I can send my clients a link to a page like this so that they can see their preview as I request payment. 
* Full resolution videos and edits from my personal projects will be posted to my youtube channel. This system is for when I don't want to post a certain video to youtube, a preview is requested for things like Real Estate Photography or when I am doing a Video Project with some degree of confidentiality for a client.
* This type of thing is immensely helpful: Emails have file size limits, even sending a short preview can prove difficult. This provides web-hosting for the content and ANY phone or computer or device can quickly view this type of preview without having to download anything. I can email you a link to this page.
* The full resolution files are huge at 4K/60FPS, I exported this video in such a way with lowered resolution so that **this video is only 17MB. I can capture a single .JPG image over 20 MB with my drone in panoramic photo mode**. 

> If you are curious as to the size of my drone footage: in the reduced-quality 12 second, 17MB video above, each 1 second of the video above is 1.4MB, with 24 frames in that second each frame has only enough data to occupy 1/20th of a MB for the image that makes up that frame, approx 50KB -- compared to the still of every frame in 4K video being 3MB (a much better photo on every frame), 60 times per second. A raw **one-minute long** 60 frame-per-second video shot at 4K is over **500MB**. A significant download size and much too large to include in an email
