> My deliverables can be up to 4K resolution and 60 FPS -- This page is an example of deliverable previews. Before clients pay me and recieve their full resolution footage  without a watermark, I will upload 8 second previews to dedicated blog pages at 1080p 24FPS and with a prominent watermark, then I will send them the link to see a preview as I request payment. The files for my drone footy are simply massive and full length/full resolution videos and edits will be posted to my youtube channel. This system is for when I don't want to post the video to youtube and a preview is requested.

### Some example footage of mine :)
