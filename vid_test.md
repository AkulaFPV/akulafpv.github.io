### Some example footage of mine (lowered resolution)

<video src="https://github.com/murdockFPV/murdockfpv.github.io/blob/master/images/LUNCH-PEAK-LOOKOUT.mp4?raw=true" poster="https://github.com/murdockFPV/murdockfpv.github.io/blob/master/images/akulafpvlunchpeak.jpg?raw=true" style="max-width: 100%; max-height: 100%" controls preload></video>

* This is not posted on youtube it is more of a private preview situation (As an example)
* My deliverables can be up to 4K resolution and 60 FPS -- This video is 1080P 24FPS with a watermark.
* The full resolution files are huge at 4K/60FPS, I exported this video in such a way with lowered resolution so that `this video is only 17MB. I can capture a single .JPG image over 20 MB with my drone in panoramic photo mode`. If you are curious as to the size of my drone footage - in the 12 second, 17MB video above, each 1 second of the video above is 1.4MB, with 24 frames in that second each frame has only enough data to occupy 1/20th of a MB for the image that makes up that frame, approx 50KB -- compared to the still of every frame in 4K video being 3MB (a much better photo on every frame), 60 times per second. A raw **one-minute long** 60 frame-per-second video shot at 4K is over **500MB**. A significant download size and much too large to include in an email
* Before I have recieved payment for client work, here is where I can upload very short, watermarked and low-resolution video previews to a dedicated page on my blog, then I can send my clients a link to a page like this so that they can see their preview as I request payment. 
* Full resolution videos and edits from my personal projects will be posted to my youtube channel. This system is for when I don't want to post a certain video to youtube, a preview is requested for things like Real Estate Photography or when I am doing a Video Project with some degree of confidentiality for a client.
* This type of thing is immensely helpful: Emails have file size limits, even sending a short preview can prove difficult. This provides web-hosting for the content and any phone or computer or device can quickly view this type of preview.
* I could just post videos on youtube and I will, but I can't post content to my youtube in every situation. This entire page is a test of the alternate solution for those situations.
