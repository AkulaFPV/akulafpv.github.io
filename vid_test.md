### Some example footage of mine :)

<video src="https://github.com/AkulaFPV/akulafpv.github.io/blob/master/vid_test/_templates/test_video.mp4?raw=true" poster="https://github.com/AkulaFPV/akulafpv.github.io/blob/master/vid_test/_templates/poster.jpg?raw=true" style="max-width: 100%; max-height: 100%" controls preload></video>

* My deliverables can be up to 4K resolution and 60 FPS -- This page is an example of deliverable previews. 
* Before clients have paid me and recieved their full resolution footage without a watermark, I can upload 8 second previews to dedicated blog pages at 1080p 24FPS and with a prominent watermark, then I can send them a link to see their preview as I request payment. 
* The files for my drone footy are simply massive and full length/full resolution videos and edits will be posted to my youtube channel. This system is for when I don't want to post the video to youtube and a preview is requested.
