## Thanks for visiting!

My name is **Justin Murdock** and I am a card-carrying FAA Part 107 UAS Pilot **(AkulaFPV)**. I own a DJI Mavic Air 2 and love to take panoramic photos and cinematic videos with it, and will soon be flying FPV drones(First Person View -- with goggles) in order to increase my skill at flying and recording action-videos.  This blog is where I put all the information I compile in my research, as I figure out all there is to know about this complicated hobby/industry, and it will also serve as the place that I post my own content. Welcome to **AkulaFPV**

### More Information

I live in beautiful North Idaho where there is so much natural beauty to film from the sky. I love filming cool stuff and being at cool events.
