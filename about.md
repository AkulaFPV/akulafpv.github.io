## Thanks for visiting!

My name is **Justin Murdock** and I love aerial cinematography. I am a card-carrying FAA Part 107 Certified UAS Pilot. I own a DJI Mavic Air 2 and love to take panoramic photos with it, and will soon be flying FPV drones(First Person View -- with goggles) in order to increase my skill at flying and recording action-videos.  This blog is where I put all the information I compile in my research for others to benefit from, as well as a place for me to post my own content. Welcome to **_Murdock FPV_**

### More Information

I live in beautiful North Idaho where there is so much natural beauty to film from the sky.
